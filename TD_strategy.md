PLANNING TD MANAGEMENT (Group 11)



1) How to include code quality cheks within your sprint activities? How to pay back TD?

We will choose "Previus version" as new code definition

At the beginning of the sprint we are creating a task to pay back T

We will use the tool at every new version (new pull request of a new implemented feature) and considering the severity of the ratings we will fix them immediatly or at the end of the sprint
