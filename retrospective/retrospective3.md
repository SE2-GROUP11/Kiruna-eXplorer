TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 11)
=====================================


The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:


- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)


## PROCESS MEASURES


### Macro statistics


- Number of stories committed vs done
  - 3/3
- Total points committed vs done
  - 11/11
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)
  - 91.45/98.45

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed



### Detailed statistics


| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_  | 23      | -      | 66.45      | 60.45        |
| #7    | 5       | 3      | 9          | 10           |
| #8    | 7       | 3      | 12.30      | 12.30        |
| #9    | 7       | 5      | 10.30      | 10.30        |


- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1



## QUALITY MEASURES


- Unit Testing:
    - Total hours estimated
      - 22
    - Total hours spent
      - 23
    - Nr of automated unit test cases
      - 83 + ...
    - Coverage (if available)
      - 79.35 + ...
- E2E testing:
    - Total hours estimated
      - 1.30
    - Total hours spent
      - 1.30
- Code review
    - Total hours estimated
      - 3
    - Total hours spent
      - 3
- Technical Debt management:
    - Strategy adopted
      - previous version as new code definition   
    - Total hours estimated estimated at sprint planning
      - 6
    - Total hours spent
      - 5





## ASSESSMENT


- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
<br>
As an example the sonarqube task was overestimated, because it was not clear to how to use the tool.
Also testing was underestimated, because we had to change the code too much.


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Positive: we learned to cooperate better as a team and communicate frequently.
  - Positive: we learned not to hesitate to ask for help. 
  - Negative: the documentation was still not used as it should.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
<br>
We achieved the 2/2 goals we set in the previous retrospective which were having additional meetings and pair programming.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
<br>
We managed to achieve all the goals we set in the previous retrospective.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
<br>
To improve quality and reliability, fix the bugs, and apply the stakeholders feedbacks, and to read and follow the documentation

  
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
<br>
We don't make project problems personal and we also spend time together outside of the project.
