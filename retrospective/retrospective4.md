TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 11)
=====================================


## PROCESS MEASURES


### Macro statistics


- Number of stories committed vs done
  - 1/1
- Total points committed vs done
  - 3/3
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)
  - 95.5/97.3

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed



### Detailed statistics


| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_  | 27      | -      | 82      | 83.8        |
| #19    | 6       | 3      | 13.5          | 13.5           |


- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
  
 average estimate: 2.89 h

 average actual: 2.34 h

 standard deviation estimate: 2.83 h

 standard deviation actual: 2.12 h
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1
  res: -0.02

## ASSESSMENT


- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

The stakeholder added the real data late so we cannot expect that we have to spent so much time at the end of the sprint.


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Positive: we follow the documentation.
  - Negative: we could possibly do one more story.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

We achieved all the goals we set in the previous retrospective which were improving the quality of the code.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

We managed to achieve all the goals we set in the previous retrospective.
  
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

We manage to create an application following the suggestions that stakeholders gave to us.
