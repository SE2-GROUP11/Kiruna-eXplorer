FIRST RETROSPECTIVE (Team 11)
=====================================

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 

  3/3
- Total points committed vs. done 

  12/12
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

  100/100

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_  |    22    |        |    54    |     56    |
| _#4_  |   14 |    5  |    23  |   21   |
| _#5_  |   3  |   5  |     6   |  6      |
| _#6_  |    8   |  2    |    17     |     17      |
   

> story `#0` is for technical tasks, leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

 average estimate: = 2.13

 average actual: = 2.13

 standard deviation estimate: 1.41

 standard deviation actual: 1.48

- Total estimation error ratio: sum of total hours spent / sum of total hours effort - 1

    $$\frac{\sum_i spent_{task_i}}{\sum_i estimation_{task_i}} - 1$$

    res: 0

- Absolute relative task estimation error: sum( abs( spent-task-i / estimation-task-i - 1))/n

    $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n \left| \frac{spent_{task_i}}{estimation_task_i}-1 \right| $$

    res: 0,068

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 22
  - Total hours spent: 21
  - Nr of automated unit test cases : 76
  - Coverage (if available): 72.5%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4
  - Total hours spent: 4
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 12
  - Total hours spent: 12
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

We made error in estimate the test's task because it was the first time we really focus on it, so we didn't know well how much time we need to perform them.
  

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

As positive learned that is better to divide the task into different category, like bug fixing,testing,review, because helps to manage better the time.

As negative we learned that we should do more meeting during the sprint instead of a big meeting before the demo.


  
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

More or less we reach our goal, but we think that we can improve next time  
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

We should pay closer attention to the documentation we produce at the beginning of the sprint

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

We should communicate more during the sprint, planning more meeting during the sprint to test the website and doing session of pair-programming so everyone in the team know better how the system works.


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

We as a team are proud that we were able to deliver the stories in a consistent way, having a good test coverage.
