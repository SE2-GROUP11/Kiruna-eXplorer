TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 11)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 

  3/3
- Total points committed vs. done 

  9/9
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

  96.39/97.25

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_  |    9    |        |     42   |    40.30      |
| _#1_  |   8 |    2  |    24.30  |   24.50   |
| _#2_  |   6  |   5  |     23.30   |  24.05      |
| _#3_  |    3   |  2    |    8     |     8h      |
   

> story `#0` is for technical tasks, leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

 average estimate: (/)=

 average actual: (/)=

 standard deviation estimate: 

 standard deviation actual:

- Total estimation error ratio: sum of total hours spent / sum of total hours effort - 1

    $$\frac{\sum_i spent_{task_i}}{\sum_i estimation_{task_i}} - 1$$

    res:

- Absolute relative task estimation error: sum( abs( spent-task-i / estimation-task-i - 1))/n

    $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n \left| \frac{spent_{task_i}}{estimation_task_i}-1 \right| $$

    res: 0

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 8
  - Total hours spent: 8
  - Nr of automated unit test cases : 6
  - Coverage (if available) 
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 3
  - Total hours spent: 3
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
